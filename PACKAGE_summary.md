## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Data
Ensure your CSV has these columns:
- `client_id` - Unique identifier
- `group` - 'A' or 'B' (seller group)
- `sale_success` - 0 or 1 (binary outcome)
- `feature_*` - Your customer characteristics

### Step 3: Update Code
Edit `seller_segmentation_template.py`:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')  # Replace data generation
categorical_features = ['cat1', 'cat2', 'cat3']  # List categorical columns
```

### Step 4: Run Analysis
```bash
python seller_segmentation_template.py
```

### Step 5: Review Results
Open `top_10_segments_results.csv` - see your top 10 segments!

## 📊 Output Table Structure

| Feature_1 | Range_1 | Feature_2 | Range_2 | Pct_Train_% | Pct_Test_% | Success_Train_% | Success_Test_% | Success_Diff_% | Method |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| num_feat_2 | >102.5 | binary_f_2 | ≤0.50 | 3.46% | 3.29% | 19.05% | 40.00% | +20.95% | tree |
| num_feat_1 | [7.2-9] | - | - | 2.36% | 2.68% | 7.14% | 25.00% | +17.86% | IV |

**What each column means:**
- **Feature_1/Range_1**: Primary segmentation rule
- **Feature_2/Range_2**: Secondary rule (if present)
- **Pct_Train/Test_%**: What % of your data this segment represents
- **Success_Train/Test_%**: Sales success rate in each set
- **Success_Diff_%**: How much better this segment performs
- **Method**: Which algorithm found this (tree/IV/LogReg)

---

## 🎯 Three Methods Explained

### 1. **T-Learner (Shallow Decision Trees)**
- **What**: Trains separate trees for each group, extracts rules
- **Best for**: Interpretable rules like "IF feature > X AND feature2 ≤ Y"
- **Pros**: Easy to understand, handles interactions naturally
- **Output**: 1-2 feature segments with clear thresholds

### 2. **Information Value (IV)**
- **What**: Ranks features by how well they separate success/failure
- **Best for**: Understanding which features matter most statistically
- **Pros**: Objective quantitative measure
- **Output**: Single-feature segments ranked by importance

### 3. **Logistic Regression (L1)**
- **What**: Sparse feature selection with median-based splits
- **Best for**: Fast, scalable analysis; automatic feature selection
- **Pros**: Penalizes complexity automatically
- **Output**: Simple split-based segments

**Use all three:** Different methods often find complementary patterns!

## 💡 How to Interpret Results

### Red Flags & Green Lights

✅ **Trust this result:**
- Success improvement > 10%
- Segment size > 3% of data
- Success_Diff_% < 5% (stable)
- Multiple methods agree

⚠️ **Use with caution:**
- Success improvement 5-10%
- Segment size 1-3%
- Success_Diff_% > 8%

❌ **Skip this one:**
- Improvement < 3%
- Size < 1%
- Success_Diff_% > 15% (likely noise)

### Example Interpretation

**Result: "num_feature_2 > 102.5, binary_feature_2 ≤ 0.5, +20.95% improvement"**

Translation:
- Customers with `num_feature_2 > 102.5` AND `binary_feature_2 ≤ 0.5`
- Have 40% success rate (vs 20% baseline)
- Represent 3.3% of your customer base
- Show consistent performance (stable test results)

**Action**: Route all matching customers to Group A

## 📈 Business Decision Framework

Use this matrix to decide which segments to implement:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Decision Level      Criteria                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ IMPLEMENT NOW      >15% improvement & >5%  │
│ PILOT FIRST        5-15% improvement & >5% │
│ COLLECT MORE DATA  >10% improvement but 1-5%│
│ SKIP               <5% improvement or <1%  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 Customization Examples

### Use Different Features
```python
# Edit in SECTION 1: generate_example_data()
# Or load your own data instead of generating
df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv')
```

### Simpler Segments (1 feature only)
```python
# Edit: extract_tree_rules_simple()
# Force feature_2 = '-'
```

### More Complex Segments (3 features)
```python
# In SECTION 4:
tree_A = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, ...)  # Instead of 2
```

### Different Success Metric
```python
# Instead of binary 0/1:
df['sale_success'] = (df['revenue'] > threshold).astype(int)
# Or use continuous:
df['sale_success'] = df['revenue']
```

### For 3+ Groups
```python
# Run analysis for each pair separately:
# A vs B, A vs C, B vs C
# Or modify to multi-class classification
```

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

Before deployment:

- [ ] Data validation (check column names, no NaN in features)
- [ ] Feature classification (did you mark categorical features correctly?)
- [ ] Segment sense check (do results match your business intuition?)
- [ ] Size adequacy (main segments >1% of data?)
- [ ] Stability check (train-test differences <10%?)

For production:

- [ ] Create routing rules in your system
- [ ] Start with 10% of volume (A/B test)
- [ ] Monitor success rates daily
- [ ] Revalidate quarterly
- [ ] Document which rules work best

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No segments found | Lower min_samples_leaf or increase max_depth |
| Too many small segments | Increase min_samples_leaf in DecisionTreeClassifier |
| Results don't make sense | Check if features are correctly labeled as categorical vs numeric |
| Very different results between methods | Normal! Use consensus from 2+ methods |
| Large train-test gap | Watch for overfitting; may indicate small population |
| All segments look alike | Groups are well-matched; consider adding new features |

---

## 📊 What to Monitor After Deployment

Track these metrics monthly:

1. **Success Rate by Segment**
   - Should maintain or exceed test performance
   - Alert if drops > 5 percentage points

2. **Rule Coverage**
   - % of new customers matching routing rules
   - Target: 60-80%

3. **Group Workload**
   - Are groups similarly loaded?
   - Any imbalance in queue times?

4. **Customer Satisfaction**
   - Any correlation with assignment type?

5. **Segment Stability**
   - Retest top 3 segments monthly
   - Alert if rankings change significantly

## 🎓 For Advanced Users

### Feature Engineering Ideas
- Add interaction terms before analysis
- Log-transform skewed numerical features
- Create ratio features (X/Y)
- Bin continuous features based on domain knowledge

### Model Tuning
- Adjust tree depth (2-4 range typical)
- Change IV binning from 5 to 3-10
- Modify LogReg C parameter (0.1-10)
- Change test_size from 0.2 to 0.1 or 0.3

### Extending Beyond 2 Groups
- One-vs-Rest: Compare each group to all others
- Tree-based: Use group as feature in a single tree
- Multiclass: Use multi-class classification approach

### Deeper Analysis
- Plot success rate vs each feature
- Analyze interaction patterns
- Study why segments work (qualitative analysis)
- A/B test individual rules

## 💬 Support & Questions

### Common Questions

**Q: What if I have many groups (A-Z)?**
A: Run pairwise analysis or modify code for multi-class

**Q: Can I use continuous targets (revenue)?**
A: Yes, replace target with continuous values

**Q: How many features should I include?**
A: 10-50 features typical; too many = noise, too few = miss patterns

**Q: What minimum dataset size?**
A: At least 500 rows per group recommended; more is better

**Q: How often should I retrain?**
A: Quarterly standard; monthly if market changes rapidly

## 🎁 Bonus: Production Routing Code

### Python Implementation
```python
def route_customer(customer_dict):
    # Apply rules in priority order
    
    # Rule 1: High-value segment to Group A
    if (customer_dict['num_feature_2'] > 102.5 and 
        customer_dict['binary_feature_2'] <= 0.5):
        return 'Group A'
    
    # Rule 2: Specialty segment to Group A  
    if 7.2 <= customer_dict['num_feature_1'] <= 9.0:
        return 'Group A'
    
    # Default: Either group (baseline)
    return 'Load Balanced'

# Apply to all customers
df['assigned_group'] = df.apply(route_customer, axis=1)
```

### SQL for CRM
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN num_feature_2 > 102.5 AND binary_feature_2 <= 0.5 
      THEN 'Group A'
    WHEN num_feature_1 BETWEEN 7.2 AND 9.0 
      THEN 'Group A'
    ELSE 'Balanced'
  END AS recommended_group
FROM customers;
```
