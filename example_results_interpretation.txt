================================================================================
2. INTERPRETATION GUIDE
================================================================================

--- SEGMENT #1: HIGH PRIORITY (Group A much better) ---

Characteristics:
  • num_feature_2 > 102.50 (large value)
  • AND binary_feature_2 ≤ 0.50 (low/false)

Performance by Group:
  • Group A baseline: ~20% success
  • Group B baseline: ~19% success (from train data)
  • This segment: 40% success (both groups together)
  • SUCCESS BOOST: +20.95%

Key Metrics:
  ✓ Test set size: 3.29% (representative)
  ✓ Train-test difference: 20.95% (shows this is a strong pattern)
  ✓ Method: Tree (highly interpretable)

Business Recommendation:
  → PRIORITIZE: Route all customers matching this profile to Group A
  → This segment shows 2x baseline success rate
  → Focus Group A training on this customer type
  → Represents ~3-4% additional volume to focus on


--- SEGMENT #2: MEDIUM PRIORITY (Group A better) ---

Characteristics:
  • num_feature_1 between 7.20 and 9.00 (narrow range)

Performance by Group:
  • Group A baseline: ~7% success
  • This segment: 25% success
  • SUCCESS BOOST: +17.86%

Key Metrics:
  ⚠ Test set size: 2.68% (small population)
  ⚠ Train-test difference: 17.86% (more variable)
  ✓ Method: IV (quantified importance)

Business Recommendation:
  → SECONDARY: Route when available, but smaller opportunity
  → Watch for volatility (test-train difference is large)
  → Validate with longer-term data before full commitment
  → Represents premium customers but rare


--- SEGMENT #8: BASELINE (No difference) ---

Characteristics:
  • binary_feature_1 between -0.00 and 0.20 (near zero)

Performance by Group:
  • Group A: 68.12% success
  • Group B: 71.43% success
  • SUCCESS DIFFERENCE: Only +3.31%

Key Metrics:
  ✓ Test set size: 36.84% (LARGE, represents main market)
  ✓ Train-test difference: 3.31% (very stable)
  ✓ Method: IV (foundational pattern)

Business Recommendation:
  → LEVERAGE: Use either group - no specialization needed
  → This is your core market (largest customer segment)
  → ~70% success rate is your baseline
  → Use other criteria to allocate within this segment (territory, workload, etc.)


================================================================================
3. DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST
================================================================================

When reviewing your results:

✓ STABILITY CHECK
  Looking at Success_Diff_%:
  • Small (< 5%): Stable pattern, safe to deploy
  • Medium (5-10%): Review further, small sample risk
  • Large (> 10%): High caution - likely overfitting

  Rule of thumb: Trust results with Diff% close to (Success_Test% - Success_Train%)

✓ SEGMENT SIZE CHECK
  Looking at Pct_Test_%:
  • > 20%: Major segment, definitely actionable
  • 5-20%: Material segment, good to optimize
  • 1-5%: Small segment, validate with additional data
  • < 1%: Likely noise, skip

✓ METHOD DISTRIBUTION
  Look at "Method" column:
  • Results from multiple methods = more confidence
  • Results from one method only = validate independently
  • Tree results = easiest to implement (just apply rules)
  • IV results = most statistically grounded

✓ FEATURE TYPES
  Interpretation varies by feature type:

  Numerical: Range_1 is interval
    • "> 100" means greater than 100
    • "[50, 100]" means between 50 and 100
    • Encoded values: Check original feature

  Categorical: Range_1 is category value
    • "= 'tech'" means category is 'tech'
    • Easy to implement in routing logic

  Binary: Range_1 is 0 or 1
    • "> 0.5" typically means = 1
    • "<= 0.5" typically means = 0


================================================================================
4. IMPLEMENTATION DECISION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

For each segment, decide based on this matrix:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DECISION MATRIX: Should we implement this routing rule?             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                     │
│ SUCCESS IMPROVEMENT > 15%  AND  SEGMENT SIZE > 5%  AND  DIFF% < 10%│
│   → YES, IMPLEMENT NOW (Quick win)                                 │
│                                                                     │
│ SUCCESS IMPROVEMENT 5-15%  AND  SEGMENT SIZE > 5%  AND  DIFF% < 8% │
│   → YES, PILOT FIRST (Lower risk, medium gain)                     │
│                                                                     │
│ SUCCESS IMPROVEMENT > 10%  AND  SEGMENT SIZE 1-5%  AND  DIFF% < 5% │
│   → MAYBE, collect more data (Small but promising)                 │
│                                                                     │
│ SUCCESS IMPROVEMENT < 5%   OR   SEGMENT SIZE < 1%   OR  DIFF% > 15%│
│   → SKIP FOR NOW (Not worth complexity)                            │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Applying to our example:

Segment #1: Improvement=20.95% ✓ Size=3.29% ✓ Diff=20.95% ✗
  → QUALIFIED for implementation (meets first 2 criteria)
  → Check business logic: does rule make sense?
  → If yes: IMPLEMENT

Segment #2: Improvement=17.86% ✓ Size=2.68% ✗ Diff=17.86% ✗
  → MAYBE category (promising but small)
  → ACTION: Monitor for future - may grow

Segment #8: Improvement=3.31% ✗ Size=36.84% ✓ Diff=3.31% ✓
  → SKIP category (too small improvement)
  → ACTION: Maintain status quo


================================================================================
5. BUSINESS RULES TEMPLATE
================================================================================

Once you've decided which segments to implement, create routing rules:

RULE #1 (High Priority):
  IF (num_feature_2 > 102.5) AND (binary_feature_2 <= 0.5)
  THEN ROUTE TO: Group A
  EXPECTED OUTCOME: 40% success vs 20% baseline (+20%)
  POPULATION: ~3% of customers
  CONFIDENCE: High (tree method, stable test performance)

RULE #2 (Secondary):
  IF (num_feature_1 >= 7.2) AND (num_feature_1 <= 9.0)
  THEN ROUTE TO: Group A
  EXPECTED OUTCOME: 25% success vs 7% baseline (+18%)
  POPULATION: ~2.7% of customers
  CONFIDENCE: Medium (small population, IV method)

DEFAULT RULE:
  IF NO SPECIAL RULES MATCH
  THEN ROUTE TO: Either group (baseline ~70% for large segment)
  EXPECTED OUTCOME: 70% success
  POPULATION: ~37% of customers
  CONFIDENCE: High (large segment, stable)


================================================================================
6. MONITORING DASHBOARD (What to track monthly)
================================================================================

Key Metrics:

1. Overall Win Rate by Route
   Current Overall: 50%
   Group A (routed): Should be > 55%
   Group B (routed): Should be > 55%
   Unrouted: Should be ~50% (baseline)

2. Win Rate by Segment
   Track each of top 5 segments separately
   Alert if any segment drops > 5 percentage points

3. Rule Coverage
   % of new customers matching routing rules
   Target: 60-80% (too low = rules too restrictive)

4. Segment Stability
   Re-test rules monthly
   Alert if top segments shift position

5. Group Utilization
   Hours/FTE per group
   Revenue per group
   Are we balanced or overloaded?


================================================================================
7. EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION CODE
================================================================================

Python example for production deployment:

```python
def route_customer(customer_data):
    # RULE #1 - High Priority (Group A)
    if (customer_data['num_feature_2'] > 102.5 and 
        customer_data['binary_feature_2'] <= 0.5):
        return 'Group A'  # Expected success: 40%

    # RULE #2 - Secondary (Group A)
    if (7.2 <= customer_data['num_feature_1'] <= 9.0):
        return 'Group A'  # Expected success: 25%

    # DEFAULT - No specialization
    if customer_data['binary_feature_1'] <= 0.5:
        return 'Either'  # Expected success: 70%

    # Fallback
    return 'Load Balanced'

# Usage
for customer in df.itertuples():
    customer.assigned_group = route_customer(customer)

# Track results
df.groupby('assigned_group')['sale_success'].mean()
```

SQL example for Salesforce/CRM routing:

```sql
CASE 
  WHEN num_feature_2 > 102.5 AND binary_feature_2 <= 0.5 
    THEN 'Group A'
  WHEN num_feature_1 BETWEEN 7.2 AND 9.0 
    THEN 'Group A'
  WHEN binary_feature_1 <= 0.5 
    THEN 'Either'
  ELSE 'Load Balanced'
END AS recommended_group
```


================================================================================
8. COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: Why is Group B not mentioned in results?
A: These results show Group A as better. If Group B specializes in certain
   segments, they would appear with positive success differences (Group B's
   success_test > Group A's).

Q: What if all results show small improvements?
A: This means groups are well-matched on current features. Consider:
   - Adding more features (customer behavior, interactions, etc.)
   - Looking at non-binary outcomes (revenue, renewal rate, etc.)
   - Checking if teams already route effectively by intuition

Q: Can I change the number of features in a segment from 2 to 3?
A: Yes, increase tree max_depth from 2 to 3:
   tree_A = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, ...)
   But remember: more features = harder to communicate & implement

Q: What if segments overlap?
A: They shouldn't in tree output (mutually exclusive paths).
   In IV output, apply them as fallback chain:
   1. Check Rule #1
   2. If no match, check Rule #2
   3. If no match, use default

Q: How often should I retrain?
A: Quarterly recommended. Monthly if:
   - Market changing rapidly
   - New features added
   - Success rates drifting significantly

9. NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. VALIDATE
   □ Show results to domain experts
   □ Ask: "Do these segments make sense?"
   □ Check: Can you easily identify these customers?

2. PILOT
   □ Implement rules on 10% of volume first
   □ Run A/B test: Routed vs Random allocation
   □ Measure: Success rate improvement
   □ Duration: 2-4 weeks minimum

3. SCALE
   □ If pilot shows > 5% improvement: Roll out 100%
   □ If improvement < 2%: Iterate on features/rules
   □ If mixed: Expand to segments showing largest impact

4. MONITOR
   □ Daily: Check rule match rates
   □ Weekly: Success rates by group
   □ Monthly: Retrain and recalibrate
   □ Quarterly: Full analysis refresh

5. OPTIMIZE
   □ After 3 months, which rules worked best?
   □ Which rules underperformed?
   □ What new features should we track?
